Most, if not all, real world data is messy. It includes errors, corruptions, inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Before
data analysis can take place, *data cleaning* is needed to identify and correct errors, 
and make the data structure and formatting consistent. This process has the potential to radically change the data,
so it must be completed with the same care and attention to reproducibility as the data analysis itself.

Consistent and transparent manipulation of data is not a task that is well suited to
spreadsheets. Fortunately, we have [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) (previously known as Google Refine) - a powerful
and free, open-source tool that was purpose-built to help clean messy data. Many people comment
that using OpenRefine for data cleaning saves them literally months of work.

This lesson will teach you how to use OpenRefine to clean and format data, and will show you how it tracks
the changes you make to automatically document the data cleaning process. 

> ## Getting Started
> This lesson assumes no prior knowledge of the computational skills or tools apart from the basic 
> understanding of tabular data stored in spreadsheets.
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](https://southampton-rsg.github.io/openrefine-data-cleaning/setup.html)" section to download the
> data we will use during the lesson.

> ## Screenshots
> Throughout this lesson we will make use and show content and screenshots from OpenRefine. As an actively 
> developed software, OpenRefine is adding new features or changing visual elements. Screenshots in this lesson have been made with 
> OpenRefine 3.3 and may have became out-of-date or not look identical as on your computer.
