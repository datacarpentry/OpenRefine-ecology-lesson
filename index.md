A part of the data workflow is preparing the data for analysis. Some of this
involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected 
or formatting
made consistent. This step must be taken with the same care and attention
to reproducibility as the analysis.

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful free and open source tool 
for working with messy 
data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another.

This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format
data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment
that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these
edits by hand.
