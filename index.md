Before you can analyze data you need to clean it. Data cleaning identifies errors and corrects formatting to create consistent data. This step must be taken with extreme care and attention because without clean data the results of analysis may be false and non-reproducible.

OpenRefine is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another.

This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to clean and format
data effectively and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment
that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these
edits by hand.
