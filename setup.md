## Software

For this lesson you will need **OpenRefine version 3.7.2** and a web browser.

Note: OpenRefine is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud). It runs inside your browser, but no web connection is needed.

Download OpenRefine version 3.7.2 from [https://openrefine.org/download](https://openrefine.org/download).

- Do not download beta versions or the release candidates. These are only for development and testing of the software.
- If you are on Windows and do not have Java installed, download the version `Windows (including Java)`.
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory and name that directory something like OpenRefine.
- Check below for further instructions depending on your operating system.

### Windows

1. Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.
2. Launch OpenRefine by double clicking on `openrefine.exe` (this will launch a black command prompt window first; ignore this window, and wait for OpenRefine to launch in the web browser, which is where you will interact with the program).

- If Windows displays a blue notification titled `Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting`, click on `More info` and then click on `Run anyway`.

1. If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:3333/](https://127.0.0.1:3333/) or [http://localhost:3333](https://localhost:3333) to launch the program.

### Mac

1. Go to your newly created OpenRefine directory.
2. Drag the OpenRefine icon into Applications folder, and `Ctrl-click/Openâ€¦` it.

- If Mac shows a notification when you try to run the program that it cannot verify the developer, click `Cancel`. Then, `Right-click` or `Ctrl-click` the icon and select `Open`. The notification will now have an `Open` button. If it does not allow to open the program, repeat the process and there will be an `Open` button the second time. For additional details, consult the [OpenRefine installation guide](https://docs.openrefine.org/manual/installing#install-or-upgrade-openrefine).

1. If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:3333/](https://127.0.0.1:3333/) or [http://localhost:3333](https://localhost:3333) to launch the program.

### Linux

1. Navigate to your newly created OpenRefine directory using the command line.
2. Type `./refine` into the terminal within the OpenRefine directory
3. If you are using a different browser, or OpenRefine does not automatically open for you, point your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:3333/](https://127.0.0.1:3333/) or [http://localhost:3333](https://localhost:3333) to launch the program.

## Web Browser

OpenRefine requires one of these web browsers installed in your computer:

- Google Chrome
- Chromium
- Safari
- Opera
- Microsoft Edge

OpenRefine has some issues with Firefox. Internet Explorer is not supported.

Note: Other versions of OpenRefine should work, but the results might be different due to changes in the software or default settings.
