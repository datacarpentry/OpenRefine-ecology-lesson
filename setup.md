## Getting ready

You need to download and install OpenRefine and download a data file to follow this lesson.

For this lesson you will need **OpenRefine** (formerly Google Refine) and a
web browser.

Note: this is a Java program that runs on your machine (not in the cloud). It runs inside your browser, but no web connection is needed.

### Downloading OpenRefine

You can download OpenRefine from [http://openrefine.org/download.html](http://openrefine.org/download.html). This lesson has been tested with all versions of OpenRefine, from 2.5 to 2.7.  

OpenRefine 2.7 is recommended.  

There are versions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

### Installing OpenRefine

When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux, you are downloading a zip file. To install OpenRefine you simply unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a "local" drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.

If you are downloading OpenRefine for Mac, you are downloading a 'dmg' (disk image) file which you can open, and then drag the OpenRefine application to an appropriate folder on you computer.

#### Windows

- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browsers installed and set as your 
default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser. It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
- Download software from [http://openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org)
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory by right-clicking and 
selecting “Extract…”. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.

#### Mac

- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browsers installed and set as your 
default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser. It will not run correctly in Internet Explorer.
- Download software from [http://openrefine.org](http://openrefine.org)
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory by double-clicking it. Name 
that directory something like OpenRefine.

#### Linux

**OpenRefine is a Java application, and you need to have a 'Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine**. If you don’t already have one installed then you can download and install from [http://java.com](http://java.com) by going to the site and clicking "Free Java Download".

### Running OpenRefine

* On Windows: Navigate to the folder where you’ve installed OpenRefine and either double-click ‘google-refine.exe’ (for Google Refine 2.5), ’openrefine.exe’ (for OpenRefine 2.7) or ‘refine.bat’ (for either)
* On Linux: Navigate to the folder where you’ve installed OpenRefine in a terminal window and type ‘./refine’
* On Mac: Navigate to where you installed OpenRefine and click the OpenRefine icon

The interface to OpenRefine is accessed via a web browser. When you run Refine normally this should open a window in your default web browser pointing at the address http://127.0.0.1:3333. If this doesn't happen automatically you can open a web browser and type in this address.
