## What is OpenRefine?
[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from
one format into another.  It provides tools that allow to understand even large data sets, and allows you to get a feel
of the "shape" and content of the data. This helps inform the direction of your later analysis of the data. 
 
It runs in a browser, which might lead you to think that it's a Web or Cloud program. It is not! It is a desktop 
Java application that uses a browser as a convenient interface. No internet connection is needed, and none of your data will be
sent to a remote server.
 
OpenRefine does not modify your original dataset. It stores your raw data set, and presents views on that data set after
applying the data cleaning steps you specify. This means you never lose your original data and you can easily undo
changes. OpenRefine saves as you go, so you can return to the project at any time and pick up where you left off. It
allows you to save the raw data, processed data and all of the data cleaning steps in a file. It also allows you to
export only your processed data to a new file. 
 
OpenRefine is:
* free
* open source ([source on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine))
* has a large growing community, from novice to expert, ready to help
* works with large-ish datasets (100,000s rows), but does not yet scale to many millions of rows.

## Why do we need a tool like OpenRefine?

It is important to know what how your data is transformed as you move from data collection to
data analysis. Sometimes you need to clean your data before you can analyse it. If you don't keep a record of how
you clean the data, you will not be able to reproduce your results - and this is vital if you want to demonstrate how
a result was generated or repeat the analysis later. Reproducibility is becoming increasingly important for journals, 
funders and other institutions. If you can demonstrate
every step in your data cleaning and analysis, it is likely to become increasingly difficult to publish results or win
funding.

Manually documenting every data cleaning step is laborious and error prone. With OpenRefine, you can capture
every step automatically, and then easily share the process with collaborators. In addition:
- OpenRefine provides tools that make data cleaning more straightforward, which saves a lot of time.
- It makes powerful but complex processes, such as clustering algorithms, easy to use.
- Any operation in OpenRefine can be easily reversed or undone.
- It is straightforward to repeat a data cleaning process across multiple files - saving even more time.

## Where to find help and further reading

You can find out more on the [OpenRefine website](http://openrefine.org) and check out some great [introductory videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqwSVsJ8CWD9pQUZDbJC1ew). There is a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine) that can 
answer a lot of beginner questions and problems. 
[OpenRefine recipes, scripts, projects, and extensions](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Recipes) are available too, where you can find useful transformations to run on your own data.

The OpenRefine GitHub wiki page has a [reference](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/GREL-Functions) of the General Refine Expression Language (GREL) used by OpenRefine. We won't be covering GREL in this lesson but it is a powerful scripting language 
that is worth learning once you get the hang of OpenRefine as it will enable you to do even more complex data cleaning 
and transformation steps.
